In this assignment we worked together to complete the Assignment 3 by using Discord and sharing the screen.
We discussed the concepts of the assignment such as socket programming and GUI programming. We brainstorm about communication about server and client.
One of us shared screen and wrote the code by discussing from Discord while one of us was checking the syntax and mistakes that we did.
We changed our tasks when we got tired.
After the assignment is done, we check the assignment separately and fixed our errors.
We use GitHub to share codes between eachothers.
We code all parts together, both of us tocuhed every part. However, the parts coded mainly these members:
